A notification toast inspired by Google Material Design.

Getting Started
---------------

Installing Snackbar is as easy as...

```bash
bower install snackbar
```
or maybe you wish to use NPM...

```bash
npm install node-snackbar
```

you can also use a CDN and just include this in your code...

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-snackbar@0.1/dist/snackbar.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-snackbar@0.1/dist/snackbar.min.css">
```

and if that doesn't float you, you can always download the CSS and JS files...
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/snackbar.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dist/snackbar.min.css" />
```

Development
---------------

In order to contribute to the development of this library you will need grunt

```bash
npm install -g grunt
```

The files that are going to be edited are in the src folder.
After making changes you will need to build the dist files by running

```bash
grunt build
```

The minified files will be on the dist folder. Those files are the ones used
on the demo html, so simply reload the page and your changes should be visible

Happy contributing!
